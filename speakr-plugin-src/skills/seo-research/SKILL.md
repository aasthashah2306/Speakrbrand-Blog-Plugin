description: Execute DataForSEO MCP tools to gather SEO validation data BEFORE blog post creation. This skill should be used when starting a new blog post project to validate keywords, analyze SERP competitors, assess competitor authority, and discover related keywords. Run this skill first, then pass the structured results to the blog-post-creation skill.
---
## Client Context Loading

Before starting any work, load the active client's brand context:

1. Read `{cwd}/.speakr/config.json` to find `clientsDir` (the colleague's chosen client storage path).
2. Read `{clientsDir}/.speakr/active-client` to get the active client slug.
3. If the user specified a different client by name in the request, use that instead.
4. If `.speakr/config.json` does not exist, or no active client is set, instruct the user to run `/client-onboarding` first.
5. Read these files for the active client:
   - `{clientsDir}/{slug}/BRAND-CONTEXT.md` — master context (identity, voice, SEO, content pillars, gaps)
   - `{clientsDir}/{slug}/WRITING-GUIDELINES.md` — full voice DNA
   - `{clientsDir}/{slug}/SEO-GUIDELINES.md` — keyword clusters, business context
   - `{clientsDir}/{slug}/brand/colors.json` — for any color references
6. If any of these files contain `# TODO:` placeholders relevant to your work, surface them to the user and offer to call `/client-onboarding` to fill the gap before proceeding.

All references in this skill to "brand voice", "keywords", "brand colors", "target audience", "internal link targets", and "content pillars" refer to the active client's context files. Do not use hardcoded examples.
