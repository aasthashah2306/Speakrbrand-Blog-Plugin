## Client Context Loading

Before starting any work, load the active client's brand context:

1. Read `{cwd}/.speakr/config.json` to find `clientsDir` (the colleague's chosen client storage path).
2. Read `{clientsDir}/.speakr/active-client` to get the active client slug.
3. If the user specified a different client by name in the request, use that instead.
4. If `.speakr/config.json` does not exist, or no active client is set, instruct the user to run `/client-onboarding` first.
5. Read these files for the active client:
   - `{clientsDir}/{slug}/BRAND-CONTEXT.md` — master context (identity, voice, SEO, content pillars, gaps)
   - `{clientsDir}/{slug}/WRITING-GUIDELINES.md` — full voice DNA
   - `{clientsDir}/{slug}/SEO-GUIDELINES.md` — keyword clusters, business context
   - `{clientsDir}/{slug}/brand/colors.json` — for any color references
6. If any of these files contain `# TODO:` placeholders relevant to your work, surface them to the user and offer to call `/client-onboarding` to fill the gap before proceeding.

All references in this skill to "brand voice", "keywords", "brand colors", "target audience", "internal link targets", and "content pillars" refer to the active client's context files. Do not use hardcoded examples.

# Blog Post Fact Checker

## Purpose

This skill performs **pure fact-checking only** - verifying claims, statistics, and assertions in blog post content against authoritative web sources using Exa.ai MCP.

**What This Skill Does:**
✅ Extracts all factual claims from blog post content
✅ Verifies each claim using `mcp__MCP_DOCKER__web_search_exa`
✅ Evaluates source authority (Tier 1/2/3 classification)
✅ Generates comprehensive Markdown fact-check report
✅ Saves report to disk AND displays as artifact
✅ Provides clear PASS/FAIL decision for next steps

**What This Skill Does NOT Do:**
❌ No editing (that's editing-checklist)
❌ No SEO analysis (that's blog-post-seo-research)
❌ No content research (that's blog-post-content-research)
❌ No style improvements (that's editing-checklist)

**ONE JOB:** Verify factual accuracy using authoritative web sources

---

## Workflow Position

**CRITICAL PLACEMENT:**

```
1. blog-post-seo-research (DataForSEO keyword/SERP research)
2. blog-post-content-research (Content/competitor research)
3. blog-post-creation (Drafting)
4. → blog-post-fact-checker (THIS SKILL) ←
5. editing-checklist (Style/readability/optimization)
```

**Why This Order:**
- Must fact-check BEFORE editing to avoid wasting time editing incorrect content
- Results may require returning to blog-post-creation for corrections
- Fact-checking must PASS before proceeding to editing

---

## Required Inputs

### Input #1: Blog Post Content (MANDATORY)
- Full blog post in Markdown format
- Must include all body content (intro, sections, conclusion)
- Should include any existing source citations

**⚠️ IF MISSING:**
Ask user: "I need the complete blog post content in Markdown format to perform fact-checking. Please provide the draft."

**Optional Context:**
- Target keyword (helps with relevant search queries)
- Blog post title (helps with reporting)

---

## Fact-Checking Workflow (5 Phases)

### Phase 1: Content Parsing & Claim Extraction

**Step 1.1: Read and Parse Content**
- Read the complete blog post Markdown content
- Note the structure (intro, body sections, conclusion)
- Identify the main topic and angle

**Step 1.2: Extract All Factual Claims**

Identify all verifiable claims:

**Statistics:**
- Percentages (e.g., "85% of marketers...")
- Numbers with context (e.g., "$4.5 billion market size")
- Growth rates (e.g., "30% year-over-year increase")
- Adoption rates (e.g., "1 in 3 companies use...")
- ROI claims (e.g., "200% return on investment")

**Product Features/Capabilities:**
- "Tool X includes feature Y"
- "Platform supports integration with Z"
- "Native capability to do ABC"
- "Built-in functionality for..."

**Industry Trends:**
- "AI adoption is accelerating"
- "Market is shifting toward..."
- "Companies are increasingly..."

**Technical Accuracy:**
- How systems work
- Architecture descriptions
- Technical specifications
- Process flows

**Comparative Claims:**
- "X is better than Y"
- "Top 5 tools for..."
- "Leading solution for..."

**Temporal Claims:**
- Dates and timelines
- "In 2024..."
- "Since last year..."
- Historical events

**Attribution:**
- "According to [Source]..."
- "Expert X said..."
- Quoted statements

**Step 1.3: Extract Context**

For each claim, capture:
- The exact claim text
- 1-2 sentences before and after (context)
- Any existing source citation
- Location in document (intro/body/conclusion)

**Step 1.4: Initial Count**

Document:
- Total claims found: [X]
- By category breakdown
- Claims with existing citations vs uncited claims

---

### Phase 2: Claim Prioritization & Categorization

**Step 2.1: Assign Priority Levels**

**CRITICAL Priority:**
- Statistics about market size, revenue, growth
- ROI and business impact numbers
- Product pricing or performance claims
- Safety/security/compliance claims

**HIGH Priority:**
- Product capabilities and feature claims
- Integration availability
- Technical specifications
- Industry adoption statistics
- Competitive comparisons

**MEDIUM Priority:**
- General industry trends
- Market direction statements
- Predictions and forecasts
- Common best practices

**LOW Priority:**
- Subjective opinions (if attributed correctly)
- Common knowledge statements
- Obvious truths

**Step 2.2: Categorize by Type**

Label each claim:
- `[STAT]` - Statistic
- `[PRODUCT]` - Product Feature/Capability
- `[TREND]` - Industry Trend
- `[TECHNICAL]` - Technical Accuracy
- `[COMPARATIVE]` - Comparison
- `[TEMPORAL]` - Date/Timeline
- `[ATTRIBUTION]` - Quoted/Attributed

**Step 2.3: Create Verification Queue**

Order claims for verification:
1. All CRITICAL priority (regardless of type)
2. All HIGH priority
3. All MEDIUM priority
4. LOW priority (if time permits)

---

### Phase 3: Verification with Exa.ai (CORE TASK)

> **This is the most important phase - verify EVERY high-value claim**

For EACH claim in priority order:

**Step 3.1: Construct Targeted Exa Query**

Use `mcp__MCP_DOCKER__web_search_exa` with strategic queries:

**For Statistics:**
```
Query: "[statistic topic] statistics 2024 2025"
Example: "AI adoption marketing statistics 2024 2025"
numResults: 5
```

**For Product Features:**
```
Query: "[product name] [feature] documentation official"
Example: "HubSpot AI agents documentation official"
numResults: 3
```

**For Industry Trends:**
```
Query: "[trend topic] report 2024 Gartner Forrester"
Example: "martech consolidation report 2024 Gartner Forrester"
numResults: 5
```

**For Technical Accuracy:**
```
Query: "[technical concept] how it works documentation"
Example: "OAuth 2.0 how it works documentation"
numResults: 3
```

**Query Best Practices:**
- Include year ("2024" or "2025") for current data
- Add authority sources ("Gartner", "Forrester", "McKinsey") for statistics
- Use "official" or "documentation" for product claims
- Use "research" or "study" for academic topics

**Step 3.2: Execute Search and Review Results**

```python
results = mcp__MCP_DOCKER__web_search_exa(
    query="[constructed query]",
    numResults=3-5  # Balance thoroughness vs speed
)
```

For EACH result returned:

1. **Check Domain Authority**
   - Is this Tier 1, 2, or 3? (see `references/source-authority-hierarchy.md`)
   - Tier 1: Gartner, Forrester, HubSpot Research, HBR, WSJ, Forbes
   - Tier 2: Industry publications, known SaaS blogs (in their domain)
   - Tier 3: Unknown blogs, content farms (AVOID)

2. **Read Content for Verification**
   - Does the content support the claim?
   - Is it the ORIGINAL source or citing someone else?
   - What's the publication date?

3. **Note Key Information**
   - Supporting quote/excerpt
   - URL and domain
   - Authority tier
   - Publication date
   - Whether it's original or secondary source

**Step 3.3: Cross-Reference Multiple Sources**

For each claim, evaluate:
- How many authoritative sources (Tier 1/2) confirm this?
- Do sources agree or contradict?
- Is there a clear original/primary source?
- Are sources current (2024-2025)?

**Verification Thresholds:**
- ✅ **VERIFIED**: 2+ Tier 1/2 sources confirm, current data (2024-2025)
- ⚠️ **PARTIALLY VERIFIED**: 1 Tier 1/2 source confirms OR data is dated (2023 or earlier)
- ❌ **UNSUPPORTED**: No Tier 1/2 sources found OR contradicted by authoritative sources
- 🔍 **NEEDS ORIGINAL SOURCE**: Found in secondary/Tier 3 source, need to trace to primary

**Step 3.4: Trace to Original Sources**

If claim appears in secondary source:
```
Found in: unknownblog.com
Article says: "According to Gartner Research..."
→ Run new Exa query: "Gartner [specific claim topic] 2024"
→ Find and cite the ORIGINAL Gartner source
```

**Always prefer original sources:**
- Research firm reports (not blog posts about them)
- Company announcements (not news articles about them)
- Academic papers (not articles citing them)

**Step 3.5: Document Verification**

For each claim, document:
- Exa query used
- Results found (URLs, domains, authority tiers)
- Supporting quotes/excerpts
- Verification status (✅ ⚠️ ❌ 🔍)
- Publication dates
- Any conflicts or issues
- Recommendation (keep/update/correct/remove)

---

### Phase 4: Analysis & Confidence Scoring

**Step 4.1: Score Each Verified Claim**

**Confidence Level:**

**HIGH Confidence:**
- 3+ Tier 1 sources confirm
- Original sources cited
- Data from 2024-2025
- No conflicts found

**MEDIUM Confidence:**
- 1-2 Tier 1/2 sources confirm
- Data from 2023-2024
- Minor discrepancies between sources

**LOW Confidence:**
- Only Tier 2/3 sources found
- Data from pre-2023
- Significant conflicts
- Unable to verify independently

**Step 4.2: Identify Patterns**

Look for:
- Multiple claims from same unverified source
- Repeated use of outdated statistics
- Product claims unsupported by official docs
- Industry trends without research backing

**Step 4.3: Prioritize Issues**

Categorize problems:

**MUST FIX (Critical):**
- Unsupported statistics (❌ CRITICAL priority claims)
- Incorrect product capabilities
- Factual errors contradicted by sources
- Dated statistics presented as current

**SHOULD FIX (High Priority):**
- Partially verified claims needing better sources
- Claims needing original source attribution
- Outdated statistics that should be updated

**CONSIDER FIXING (Medium Priority):**
- Low confidence claims with weak sources
- Unverified trend statements
- Missing source citations

---

### Phase 5: Report Generation (MANDATORY OUTPUTS)

> **Critical: Create BOTH outputs**

**Step 5.1: Generate Markdown Report**

Use the template from `guidelines/output-format-template.md`:

**Report Structure:**
1. **Header**: Title, date, summary statistics
2. **Executive Summary**: 2-3 sentences on overall results
3. **Decision**: PASS / MINOR ISSUES / FAIL
4. **Critical Issues**: List any must-fix items
5. **Detailed Verification Results**: Every claim with full verification
6. **Summary Statistics**: Counts and percentages
7. **Source Authority Breakdown**: Tier 1/2/3 usage
8. **Recommendations**: Must fix / Should fix / Consider fixing
9. **Next Steps**: Clear direction on what to do next
10. **Methodology**: Tools and approach used

**Step 5.2: Save to Disk**

```python
filename = f"fact-check-report-{keyword.replace(' ', '-')}-{date}.md"
# Save to working directory
```

Example: `fact-check-report-hubspot-ai-agents-2025-01-26.md`

**Step 5.3: Display as Artifact**

**CRITICAL: Use artifact feature to display the report**

The report must be presented as an artifact in the conversation so:
- User can review without conversation clutter
- Report is easy to download/save
- User can reference while deciding next steps

**Step 5.4: Provide Clear Decision**

End with explicit decision:

```markdown
## DECISION

✅ **PASS** - Ready to proceed to editing-checklist
- All critical and high-priority claims verified
- Minor issues can be addressed during editing
- No factual accuracy concerns

⚠️ **MINOR ISSUES** - Review before proceeding
- [X] medium-priority claims need attention
- Decision: Fix now OR address during editing
- No critical factual errors found

❌ **FAIL** - Return to blog-post-creation
- [X] critical claims unsupported or incorrect
- [Y] high-priority issues require correction
- Must fix before editing can begin
```

**Step 5.5: Hand Off**

If PASS: "This fact-check report shows all critical facts are verified. You can now proceed to the editing-checklist skill."

If MINOR ISSUES: "This fact-check report identifies [X] issues. You can either address them now or proceed to editing. What would you like to do?"

If FAIL: "This fact-check report identifies critical factual issues. The content should be returned to blog-post-creation for corrections. Here's the report detailing what needs to be fixed."
