## Client Context Loading

Before starting any work, load the active client's brand context:

1. Read `{cwd}/.speakr/config.json` to find `clientsDir` (the colleague's chosen client storage path).
2. Read `{clientsDir}/.speakr/active-client` to get the active client slug.
3. If the user specified a different client by name in the request, use that instead.
4. If `.speakr/config.json` does not exist, or no active client is set, instruct the user to run `/client-onboarding` first.
5. Read these files for the active client:
   - `{clientsDir}/{slug}/BRAND-CONTEXT.md` — master context (identity, voice, SEO, content pillars, gaps)
   - `{clientsDir}/{slug}/WRITING-GUIDELINES.md` — full voice DNA
   - `{clientsDir}/{slug}/SEO-GUIDELINES.md` — keyword clusters, business context
   - `{clientsDir}/{slug}/brand/colors.json` — for any color references
6. If any of these files contain `# TODO:` placeholders relevant to your work, surface them to the user and offer to call `/client-onboarding` to fill the gap before proceeding.

All references in this skill to "brand voice", "keywords", "brand colors", "target audience", "internal link targets", and "content pillars" refer to the active client's context files. Do not use hardcoded examples.

```

---

### Phase 2: Content Research

> **📋 Brand context comes from the active client folder: `{clientsDir}/{slug}/BRAND-CONTEXT.md`** (loaded automatically — see Client Context Loading above).
> Reference this document to ensure research aligns with the client's positioning as AI builder + Joy-Success Cycle thought leader, his credentials, and target audience (CTOs, founders, C-suite).

**Step 2.1: Primary Content Research (web_search_exa)**

**Tool:** `mcp__MCP_DOCKER__web_search_exa`

Execute 4-6 targeted searches:

```
Search 1: web_search_exa("[keyword] 2025", numResults=5)
→ Purpose: Find latest content on primary topic

Search 2: web_search_exa("[keyword] guide best practices", numResults=5)
→ Purpose: Identify how-to content and practical approaches

Search 3: web_search_exa("[related topic] trends statistics", numResults=5)
→ Purpose: Find current trends and data

Search 4: web_search_exa("[industry] [keyword] case studies", numResults=5)
→ Purpose: Find real-world examples and outcomes

Search 5: web_search_exa("[product/tool] features updates", numResults=5)
→ Purpose: Find latest product information (if applicable)

Search 6: web_search_exa("[problem] solutions", numResults=5)
→ Purpose: Identify pain points and solutions
```

**For Each Search Result:**
- Note URL, title, and publication date
- Extract key insights and unique angles
- Identify relevant statistics (with sources)
- Note content gaps or missing perspectives
- Flag outdated information (pre-2024)

**Step 2.2: Deep Research (perplexity_research)**

**Tool:** `mcp__MCP_DOCKER__perplexity_research`

Use for complex topics requiring multiple authoritative sources:

```python
perplexity_research({
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "What are the latest statistics on [topic] for 2025? Focus on [specific aspects]. Include only authoritative sources like research firms, industry leaders, and major publications."
    }
  ]
})
```

**Use Cases:**
- Market size and growth statistics
- Industry adoption rates
- ROI and business impact data
- Technology trends and predictions
- Comprehensive topic overviews

**Step 2.3: Fact Validation (perplexity_reason)**

**Tool:** `mcp__MCP_DOCKER__perplexity_reason`

Verify critical claims and statistics:

```python
perplexity_reason({
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "Verify this claim: '[specific claim or statistic]'. Provide reasoning, confirm accuracy, and cite authoritative sources."
    }
  ]
})
```

**Validate:**
- All statistics found in web searches
- Product claims and feature descriptions
- Industry trends and predictions
- Technical accuracy of concepts

---

### Phase 3: Competitor Content Analysis

**Purpose:** Analyze competitor articles for CONTENT insights (not SEO structure)

**Step 3.1: Select Top Articles**

From web_search_exa results, select 5-7 top articles:
- Prefer recent publications (last 6-12 months)
- Prioritize authoritative sources
- Include diverse perspectives

**Step 3.2: Analyze Content (Not SEO)**

For each selected article, analyze:

**Content Analysis (NOT SEO Structure):**
- **Unique Angle:** What perspective does this article take?
- **Key Insights:** What are the main takeaways?
- **Statistics Used:** What data points are cited? (with sources)
- **Content Depth:** How deeply does it cover the topic?
- **Examples/Case Studies:** What real-world examples are used?
- **Topics Covered:** What subtopics are addressed?
- **Gaps Identified:** What's missing or could be improved?

**Document in Content Analysis Template:**
```
Article 1: [Title] - [URL]
Published: [Date]
Source: [Domain]

Unique Angle:
- [perspective/approach]

Key Insights:
- [insight 1]
- [insight 2]
- [insight 3]

Statistics Found:
- [statistic 1] - Source: [original source]
- [statistic 2] - Source: [original source]

Topics Covered:
- [topic A]
- [topic B]
- [topic C]

Content Gaps Identified:
- [missing topic 1]
- [shallow coverage of topic 2]
- [outdated information on topic 3]
```

**Step 3.3: Cross-Article Pattern Analysis**

After analyzing all articles, identify:

**Universal Topics (All articles cover):**
- [topic 1] - Must-include topic
- [topic 2] - Must-include topic
- [topic 3] - Must-include topic

**Common Angles:**
- [angle 1] - Frequency: 5/7 articles
- [angle 2] - Frequency: 4/7 articles

**Content Gaps (Opportunities):**
- [gap 1] - NONE of the articles cover this
- [gap 2] - Only 1 article mentions this briefly
- [gap 3] - All articles have outdated info (pre-2024)

**Statistics Summary:**
- Most cited sources: [list authoritative sources found]
- Common data points: [list frequently cited statistics]
- Missing data: [statistics we need to find]

---

### Phase 4: Source Authority Validation

> **📋 For source authority hierarchy, see: `references/planning-framework.md`**

**Step 4.1: Review All Statistics Found**

For EVERY statistic you plan to use:
- [ ] Is the source a recognized authority? (Tier 1 or 2)
- [ ] Is this the ORIGINAL source? (not citing someone else)
- [ ] Is the data current? (2024-2025 preferred)
- [ ] Would I trust this source as a reader?

**Authority Hierarchy:**

**Tier 1 - ALWAYS ACCEPTABLE:**
- Research firms: Forrester, Gartner, McKinsey, Deloitte
- Academic: Harvard Business Review, MIT, Stanford research
- Industry leaders: HubSpot Research, Salesforce, Adobe
- Major publications: Forbes, Wall Street Journal, Bloomberg

**Tier 2 - ACCEPTABLE:**
- Established industry publications: MarketingProfs, TechCrunch
- Known SaaS blogs: Intercom, Drift (for their domain)
- Recognized analysts: Nielsen, Statista

**Tier 3 - AVOID:**
- Unknown blogs
- Content farms
- Secondary sources citing primary sources

**Step 4.2: Trace to Original Sources**

For each statistic:
```
Found: "[statistic]" from unknownblog.com
→ Check article: "According to [Original Source] report..."
→ Verify with original: Use web_search_exa to find original report
→ Cite correctly: "Source: [Original Source]"
```

**Step 4.3: Track Domain Usage**

**CRITICAL: Each domain used ONCE only**

```
DOMAIN TRACKING:
- hubspot.com ✓ (used for statistic about AI adoption)
- forrester.com ✓ (used for ROI statistic)
- mckinsey.com ✓ (used for productivity statistic)
- salesforce.com ❌ (not yet used - available)
```

### Phase 5: Architecture, Workflow & Entity Mapping (MANDATORY)

> **This is CRITICAL to prevent misunderstandings, entity conflation, and relationship misattribution in the final blog post**

**Why Architecture & Workflow Matter:**

Understanding HOW things connect, work together, and relate to each other is essential for accurate content. Without clear architecture and workflow mapping, we risk:
- **Conflating separate entities** that merely work together or relate to each other
- **Misattributing characteristics, capabilities, or actions** to the wrong entity
- **Confusing relationship types and boundaries** between connected entities
- **Creating false equivalencies** between different concepts

**This applies universally across ALL domains:**

Whether you're researching software tools, business partnerships, organizational structures, funding models, events, content strategies, services, people, processes, or any other topic - you must understand:

1. **What each entity IS** (its essential nature and boundaries)
2. **How entities RELATE** (the nature of connections between them)
3. **What INITIATES or ENABLES** actions and outcomes
4. **What are the PREREQUISITES** or foundations
5. **What are COMMON MISCONCEPTIONS** about relationships

**The goal:** Ensure the blog post creator has a clear mental model of how everything fits together, preventing misrepresentation and confusion.

---

**Step 5.1: Identify All Entities & Components**

**IMPORTANT:** The categories below are EXAMPLES only. Your job is to identify what entities are relevant to YOUR specific topic. The categories will vary dramatically based on what you're researching.

**For your specific topic, identify:**

**Primary Entities:**
- What are the main "things" (people, organizations, tools, concepts, events, etc.) that matter in this topic?
- What are their essential characteristics?

**Secondary Entities:**
- What supporting entities exist?
- What additional players, factors, or elements are involved?

**Ask yourself these universal questions:**

1. **WHO/WHAT questions:**
   - Who or what are the key players/participants/actors?
   - What tools, systems, methods, or concepts are involved?
   - What outcomes, results, or impacts occur?

2. **RELATIONSHIP questions:**
   - Which entities are closely connected? How?
   - Which entities are often confused with each other? Why?
   - Which entities work together vs. which are separate?

3. **BOUNDARY questions:**
   - Where does one entity end and another begin?
   - What belongs TO an entity vs. what WORKS WITH it?
   - What REQUIRES something vs. what INCLUDES something?

4. **MISCONCEPTION questions:**
   - What do people commonly get wrong about these relationships?
   - What false assumptions exist?
   - What gets unfairly lumped together or separated?

**Entity identification will look different for each topic:**

**THESE ARE ILLUSTRATIVE EXAMPLES ONLY** - to show you the breadth of possibilities. Your topic may have completely different entity types. Think critically about YOUR specific topic.

- Software/Tech: Tools, features, integrations, users, processes, APIs, triggers, platforms
- Business/Partnerships: Companies, alliances, revenue models, stakeholders, agreements, channels
- People/Roles: Individuals, teams, organizations, responsibilities, hierarchies, influencers
- Events/Conferences: Speakers, attendees, sponsors, sessions, venues, formats, outcomes
- Content/Media: Formats, channels, creators, audiences, strategies, distribution, engagement
- Funding/Investment: Investors, companies, rounds, terms, valuations, stages, instruments
- Services/Offerings: Providers, clients, deliverables, pricing models, support, SLAs
- Regulations/Compliance: Rules, governing bodies, requirements, certifications, audits, penalties
- Research/Science: Studies, researchers, institutions, methodologies, findings, publications
- Supply Chain/Logistics: Suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, retailers, inventory, transportation
- Healthcare/Medical: Providers, patients, treatments, facilities, insurance, regulations
- Education/Training: Instructors, students, curricula, institutions, certifications, methodologies
- Real Estate/Property: Properties, buyers, sellers, agents, financing, zoning, development
- Legal/Contracts: Parties, agreements, clauses, jurisdictions, enforcement, disputes

**The list above is NOT exhaustive.** Your topic might involve:
- Marketing campaigns and their components
- Customer journeys and touchpoints
- Product launches and their phases
- Mergers and acquisitions
- Crisis management protocols
- Innovation ecosystems
- Community programs
- Sustainability initiatives
- Brand positioning frameworks
- Risk management strategies
- Or something completely different!

**Your goal:** Identify ALL entities that matter to YOUR specific topic - whether they fit these categories or not. Don't force your topic into these boxes. Let the entities emerge naturally from your research.

**Step 5.2: Document Architecture & Relationships**

**CRITICAL: Map how entities connect and relate to each other**

For each major entity, understand and document its relationships with other entities. **The types of relationships will vary based on your topic.**

**Universal relationship mapping questions:**

1. **Intrinsic vs External:**
   - What is INHERENT to this entity? (its essential nature)
   - What is EXTERNAL but connected? (separate entities that relate)

2. **Boundary Clarity:**
   - Where does this entity END and another BEGIN?
   - What belongs TO it vs what CONNECTS WITH it?
   - What is it vs what does it ENABLE or USE?

3. **Nature of Connections:**
   - How are entities CONNECTED? (What's the relationship type?)
   - Is it: ownership, partnership, dependency, causation, enablement, collaboration, competition, hierarchy, sequence, conditionality, or something else?

4. **Directionality:**
   - Is the relationship ONE-WAY or TWO-WAY?
   - Which entity influences/affects/initiates/depends on the other?
   - What's the flow of value, data, control, or resources?

5. **Conditionality:**
   - Are relationships ALWAYS true or CONDITIONAL?
   - What must be true for the relationship to exist?
   - What changes the nature of the relationship?

6. **Common Misunderstandings:**
   - What do people WRONGLY assume about this relationship?
   - What gets CONFLATED that should be separate?
   - What gets SEPARATED that should be together?

**Architecture Documentation Template:**

**Adapt this structure to YOUR topic. The relationship categories below are flexible - use what makes sense for your domain.**

```
Entity: [Name of entity]

Essential Nature: [What this entity fundamentally IS - one sentence]

Intrinsic Characteristics:
├── [What inherently belongs to/defines this entity]
├── [What is inseparable from it]
└── [What makes it what it is]

Connected Entities (and relationship type):
├── [Entity A] - [Relationship: e.g., enables, requires, partners with, competes with, reports to, funds, produces, consumes, etc.]
├── [Entity B] - [Relationship type]
└── [Entity C] - [Relationship type]

Conditional Relationships:
├── IF [condition], THEN [this entity] → [relates to] → [that entity]
└── WHEN [situation], [entity A] and [entity B] interact as: [description]

Directional Flows:
├── [Entity] → provides/delivers/sends → [value/data/resource] → to [Entity]
├── [Entity] ← receives/depends on/requires ← [value/data/resource] ← from [Entity]

Common Misconceptions:
├── ❌ WRONG: [common false belief about this entity or its relationships]
│   ✅ CORRECT: [accurate understanding]
├── ❌ WRONG: [another misconception]
│   ✅ CORRECT: [correction]
```

**Architecture Documentation Examples:**

**⚠️ IMPORTANT: These are ILLUSTRATIVE EXAMPLES ONLY** to show you how relationship mapping works across different domains. Your documentation will look different based on YOUR specific topic. Don't copy these structures - adapt the concept to your needs.

---

**Example 1: Funding/Investment Domain**
```
Entity: Series B Funding Round

Essential Nature: Mid-stage venture capital investment event where companies raise $10M-$50M to scale operations

Intrinsic Characteristics:
├── Equity dilution (founders give up ownership percentage)
├── Board seat allocation (investors gain governance rights)
└── Milestone-based tranches (capital released in stages)

Connected Entities (and relationship types):
├── Lead Investor → provides → majority of capital → drives terms
├── Participating Investors → contribute → remaining capital → follow lead's terms
├── Company → receives → capital → in exchange for → equity
├── Existing Shareholders → experience → dilution
├── Series A Round → precedes → establishes valuation baseline
├── Series C Round → follows → if growth targets met

Common Misconceptions:
├── ❌ WRONG: "Series B funding includes Series A investors"
│   ✅ CORRECT: Series A investors may participate in Series B, but they are separate funding events with different terms
├── ❌ WRONG: "The company owns the Series B funding"
│   ✅ CORRECT: Investors own equity received; company receives and deploys capital
```

---

**Example 2: People/Organization Domain**
```
Entity: Chief Revenue Officer (CRO)

Essential Nature: Executive responsible for all revenue-generating functions across sales, marketing, and customer success

Intrinsic Characteristics:
├── Strategic revenue planning authority
├── Cross-functional leadership responsibility
└── Board-level reporting obligations

Connected Entities (and relationship types):
├── CEO → CRO reports to → provides strategic direction
├── VP Sales → reports to → CRO → manages sales execution
├── VP Marketing → reports to → CRO → manages demand generation
├── VP Customer Success → reports to → CRO → manages retention/expansion
├── CFO → collaborates with → CRO → on revenue forecasting
├── Board of Directors ← receives reports from ← CRO → on revenue performance

Conditional Relationships:
├── IF company < $50M revenue, THEN CRO may also manage → Sales directly
└── WHEN CRO is hired externally, existing VPs may → report to → or → depart

Common Misconceptions:
├── ❌ WRONG: "CRO is just a fancy title for VP Sales"
│   ✅ CORRECT: CRO oversees all revenue functions; VP Sales manages only sales team
├── ❌ WRONG: "Marketing doesn't report to CRO"
│   ✅ CORRECT: In revenue-focused orgs, marketing typically reports to CRO
```

---

**Example 3: Event/Conference Domain**
```
Entity: Annual Industry Conference (3-day event)

Essential Nature: Multi-day gathering bringing together professionals, vendors, and thought leaders for education, networking, and business development

Intrinsic Characteristics:
├── Keynote presentations (main stage content)
├── Breakout sessions (specialized tracks)
├── Expo hall (vendor booths)
└── Networking events (structured and informal)

Connected Entities (and relationship types):
├── Organizing Body → produces → event → collects revenue from registrations/sponsorships
├── Attendees → pay → registration fees → receive → access to content/networking
├── Sponsors → pay → sponsorship fees → receive → brand visibility/lead generation
├── Speakers → deliver → content → receive → speaking fees or exposure
├── Venue → provides → physical space → receives → rental fees
├── Media Partners → promote → event → receive → content access/brand association

Directional Flows:
├── Sponsors → provide → funding → to → Organizing Body
├── Organizing Body → provides → attendee data → to → Sponsors (with consent)
├── Speakers → deliver → value/content → to → Attendees
├── Attendees → generate → networking opportunities → for → each other

Common Misconceptions:
├── ❌ WRONG: "Sponsors are part of the conference organizing team"
│   ✅ CORRECT: Sponsors are external entities paying for visibility; organizers are separate
├── ❌ WRONG: "All speakers are paid by the conference"
│   ✅ CORRECT: Some speak for exposure; some are paid; some sponsor to speak
```

---

**Your documentation should:**
- Identify what's unique to your topic
- Map the actual relationships that exist
- Clarify common confusions specific to your domain
- Not force-fit these example structures

**Step 5.3: Create Mermaid Entity Relationship Diagram**

**MANDATORY: Create a comprehensive ERD**

```mermaid
erDiagram
    MARKETER ||--o{ SOCIAL_POST : creates
    MARKETER ||--|| SOCIAL_AGENT : uses
    SOCIAL_AGENT ||--o{ SOCIAL_POST : generates
    SOCIAL_POST ||--o{ USER : reaches
    USER ||--o{ ENGAGEMENT : produces

    MARKETER {
        string role "Content creator"
        string pain_point "Time-consuming manual posting"
        string desired_outcome "Automation and time savings"
    }

    SOCIAL_AGENT {
        string type "AI automation tool"
        string capability "Content generation"
        string capability "Scheduling"
    }

    SOCIAL_POST {
        string content "Generated or manual"
        string timing "Scheduled"
        string platform "LinkedIn, Twitter, etc"
    }

    USER {
        string role "Content consumer"
        string behavior "Engages with posts"
    }

    ENGAGEMENT {
        number likes "User interaction"
        number comments "User feedback"
        number shares "Content amplification"
    }
```

**ERD Must Show:**
- All primary entities
- Relationships between entities (creates, uses, generates, etc.)
- Entity attributes (what defines each entity)
- Statistical attribution (which stats apply to which entities)

---

**Step 5.4: Create Workflow/Process Diagrams (MANDATORY)**

**Why Workflow Diagrams Matter:**

Workflow diagrams visualize HOW processes unfold over time, showing:
- Sequence of events and actions
- Decision points and branches
- Trigger conditions and initiators
- Dependencies and prerequisites
- Integration points and handoffs

**Create workflow diagrams using Mermaid flowcharts or sequence diagrams.**

**Workflow Diagram Guidelines:**

Choose the appropriate diagram type:
- **Flowchart:** For decision trees, process flows, conditional logic
- **Sequence Diagram:** For interactions between entities over time
- **State Diagram:** For status changes and lifecycle stages
- **Journey Map:** For user/customer experiences

**Example 1: Software Tool Workflow (Flowchart)**

```mermaid

```

**Your Workflow Diagram Must Show:**

1. **Entry Points:** How does the process begin? (trigger, manual start, scheduled)
2. **Key Steps:** What are the main actions/stages?
3. **Decision Points:** Where do choices/branches occur?
4. **Integrations:** Where do external systems connect?
5. **Triggers:** What initiates different paths?
6. **Dependencies:** What must happen before next step?
7. **Outcomes:** What are the possible endpoints?

**Workflow Documentation Template:**

```
Workflow: [Name of process/workflow]

└── [Decision 2] - Condition: [criteria]
    ├── Path A: [outcome if true]
    └── Path B: [outcome if false]

Integration Points:
├── [System 1] - Data exchange at [stage]
├── [System 2] - Triggers action at [stage]
└── [System 3] - Receives output at [stage]

Outcomes:
├── [Success Outcome] - Process completes successfully
├── [Alternative Outcome] - Alternative completion path
└── [Exception Outcome] - Error handling / fallback
```

---

**Step 5.5: Document Entity-Statistic Mapping**

For EACH statistic found, document which entity it describes:

```
Entity-Statistic Mapping:

Statistic: "Teams spend 15-20 hours weekly on social scheduling"
→ Entity: MARKETER (creators, not consumers)
→ Context: Time spent creating/scheduling content
→ Valid Usage: Discussing marketer pain points

Statistic: "Users spend 2.5 hours daily on social media"
→ Entity: USER (consumers, not creators)
→ Context: Time spent consuming content
→ Valid Usage: Discussing audience reach, NOT marketer tools

Statistic: "AI tools reduce content creation time by 70%"
→ Entity: SOCIAL_AGENT (tool capability)
→ Context: Tool effectiveness
→ Valid Usage: Discussing automation benefits for MARKETERS
```

**Step 5.6: Identify Entity Mismatch Risks**

Flag statistics that could be misattributed:

```
⚠️ RISK: "2.5 hours daily on social platforms"
→ This describes USER behavior (consuming content)
→ DO NOT use to describe MARKETER tools (creating content)
→ Find alternative: Marketer time spent on content creation

✅ SAFE: "15-20 hours weekly on scheduling"
→ This describes MARKETER activity (creating/scheduling)
→ CAN use to describe automation tools for marketers
→ Matches entity context correctly
```

**Step 5.7: Architecture & Workflow Quality Check**

Before proceeding to Phase 6, verify:

**Architecture Documentation:**
- [ ] Core components clearly identified (what's built-in)
- [ ] Integrations/extensions documented (what's optional)
- [ ] Triggers/initiators mapped (what activates functionality)
- [ ] Dependencies listed (what's required)
- [ ] Relationships clarified (what connects/relates)

**Workflow Visualization:**
- [ ] Workflow diagram created (flowchart, sequence, or state diagram)
- [ ] Entry points documented
- [ ] Key stages/steps identified
- [ ] Decision points shown
- [ ] Integration points mapped
- [ ] Triggers illustrated
- [ ] Outcomes/endpoints defined

**Common Architecture Pitfalls:**
❌ Saying "X includes Y" when Y is actually a trigger for X
❌ Claiming "Feature is part of Tool" when it's a separate integration
❌ Confusing "works with" and "requires"
❌ Not distinguishing core vs optional capabilities
❌ Missing the workflow sequence and decision logic
