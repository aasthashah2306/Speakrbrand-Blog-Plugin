description: "Generate production-quality blog graphics as React/JSX artifacts that render directly in Claude's interface for immediate visual preview. CRITICAL WORKFLOW: (1) Create .jsx artifact file → user sees rendered graphic in interface, (2) Get approval, (3) Convert to web-ready HTML/CSS modules. NEVER output code in chat unless converting to HTML/CSS. Always creates actual .jsx React artifacts (NOT markdown code blocks) that render visually. Supports multiple graphics per article. Brand colors, logo, and typography are loaded from the active client's brand/ folder — never hardcoded. Use when creating embeddable graphics for blog posts that need visual preview."
---
## Client Context Loading

Before generating any graphic, load the active client's brand assets. **Never hardcode colors, fonts, or logos** — they always come from the client's brand folder.

1. Read `{cwd}/.speakr/config.json` to find `clientsDir`.
2. Read `{clientsDir}/.speakr/active-client` for the active client slug.
3. Load brand assets from the active client folder:
   - `{clientsDir}/{slug}/brand/colors.json` — `primary`, `secondary`, `accent`, `background`, `text`
   - `{clientsDir}/{slug}/brand/typography.json` — `headingFont`, `bodyFont`, `monoFont`
   - `{clientsDir}/{slug}/brand/logo.png` — for logo placements (and `logo-dark.png` if present)
4. If any of these files are missing, surface the gap and offer two paths:
   - Run `/client-onboarding` with the "fill gap" operation to collect them now
   - Proceed with sensible defaults (neutral palette, Inter font, no logo) and warn the user
5. If `.speakr/config.json` is missing, instruct the user to run `/client-onboarding` first.

Every JSX artifact must:
- Define a `BRAND` constant at the top that reads from the loaded `colors.json` and `typography.json`
- Reference colors as `BRAND.primary`, `BRAND.accent`, etc. — not as inline hex codes
- Reference fonts as `BRAND.headingFont`, `BRAND.bodyFont` — not as inline font names

This makes graphics auto-rebrand when colors.json changes and prevents Kevin-style color leaks across clients.

---

## 🛑 PRECONDITION — TEXT APPROVAL REQUIRED

**This skill refuses to start until the user has approved the blog post text.** No exceptions.

### Step 0: Check for the text-approval marker

Before doing anything else, check for `{cwd}/.speakr/last-approved-text.json`. This file is written by `blog-post-creation` Phase 5 when the user approves the text.

**If the marker exists AND is for the active client AND is recent (within the last 24 hours):**

Proceed to graphics generation. The marker confirms the text is locked.

**If the marker is missing OR is for a different client OR is older than 24 hours:**

Refuse to run. Tell the user:

> I can't start graphics yet — the blog post text hasn't been approved.
>
> Graphics should always come **after** text is final, because:
> - Rewriting graphics after text changes is expensive
> - Graphic placements depend on final section structure
> - Visual choices reflect the final argument, not a draft
>
> **Next step:** Finish writing the post with `blog-post-creation`. Once you approve the text, come back and I'll generate the graphics.

If the user pushes back ("just generate something to see"), explain again and decline. The ordering is enforced for a reason.

### Step 0.1: Read the approved draft

Once the marker check passes, read the approved draft from the `draftPath` in `last-approved-text.json`. Use it as the source for:
- Identifying graphic opportunities (3-5 placements)
- Pulling concepts to visualize
- Matching graphic style to the post's tone

# Blog Graphics Artifact Generator

Generate professional blog graphics as **actual React/JSX artifacts** that render directly in Claude's interface. Supports **multiple graphics per article**.

## 🔧 Technical Implementation (Read This First!)

**HOW TO CREATE ARTIFACTS:**

```python
# Use the create_file tool to save .jsx files
create_file(
  description="Creating blog graphic",
  path="/mnt/user-data/outputs/graphic-name.jsx",
  file_text="import { Icon } from 'lucide-react';\n\nexport default function..."
)

# Then provide the artifact link
"Here's your graphic: [View graphic](computer:///mnt/user-data/outputs/graphic-name.jsx)"
```

**WHAT HAPPENS:**
1. ✅ File saves to `/mnt/user-data/outputs/` with .jsx extension
2. ✅ Claude's interface automatically renders it as a visual artifact
3. ✅ User sees RENDERED GRAPHIC (not code)
4. ✅ User can click link to view/interact with artifact

**WHAT NOT TO DO:**
- ❌ Never output JSX code in markdown code blocks in chat
- ❌ Never show code to user (unless converting to HubSpot)
- ❌ Never let user see code when they asked for a graphic

**WORKFLOW:**
1. Create → use `create_file` for .jsx file → user sees rendered graphic
2. Iterate → use `str_replace` to update .jsx → user sees updated graphic  
3. Convert → ONLY NOW output HTML/CSS in markdown code blocks for HubSpot

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: React Artifact Workflow (Technical Implementation)

**THIS IS THE MANDATORY WORKFLOW - NEVER DEVIATE:**

### Technical Steps

1. **Use `create_file` tool** to save a .jsx file to `/mnt/user-data/outputs/`
   - Example: `/mnt/user-data/outputs/blog-graphic.jsx`
   - The .jsx file will automatically render as a visual artifact in Claude's interface
   - User will see the RENDERED graphic, NOT the code

2. **ABSOLUTELY NO CODE IN CHAT** 
   - Do NOT output JSX/TSX code in markdown code blocks
   - Do NOT show code to the user (unless converting to HubSpot)
   - User must see the visual result rendered in the interface

3. **Get user approval on the rendered visual**
   - Wait for feedback on the design shown in the interface
   - Make iterations by updating the .jsx file if needed

4. **Only after approval, convert to HubSpot**
   - NOW output HTML/CSS/JS in markdown code blocks
   - Provide complete HubSpot module code for deployment

### How Artifacts Work

When you use `create_file` to save a .jsx file:
- ✅ File is saved to `/mnt/user-data/outputs/graphic-name.jsx`
- ✅ Claude's interface automatically detects the .jsx extension
- ✅ The React component renders visually in the interface
- ✅ User sees the graphic, NOT the code
- ✅ You provide a link to the rendered artifact

### What NOT to Do

❌ **NEVER output code in markdown blocks like this:**
```jsx
import { Database } from 'lucide-react';
export default function MyGraphic() { ... }
```

❌ **NEVER show JSX/TSX code in the chat thread**
❌ **NEVER let users read code when they asked for graphics**

### What TO Do

✅ **ALWAYS use create_file tool:**
```
create_file(
  path="/mnt/user-data/outputs/blog-graphic.jsx",
  content="import { Database } from 'lucide-react';\n\nexport default function..."
)
```

✅ **ALWAYS provide artifact link after creation**
✅ **ALWAYS let user see rendered visual, not code**

**Example of CORRECT workflow:**
```
User: "Create a three-column infographic"

Claude: [Uses create_file tool]:
        create_file(
          path="/mnt/user-data/outputs/three-column-infographic.jsx",
          content="import { Database, RotateCw, Gauge } from 'lucide-react';\n\nexport default function..."
        )
        
        [Provides link to rendered artifact]
        
        "Here's your three-column infographic: [View graphic](computer:///mnt/user-data/outputs/three-column-infographic.jsx)"
        
        [User sees RENDERED GRAPHIC in interface, NOT code]

User: "Perfect! Convert to HubSpot"

Claude: [NOW outputs HTML/CSS in markdown code blocks]
        
        ### module.html
        ```html
        <div class="three-column-infographic">...</div>
        ```
```

**Example of INCORRECT workflow (NEVER DO THIS):**
```
User: "Create a three-column infographic"

Claude: "Here's the TSX code:"
        ```tsx
        import { Database } from 'lucide-react';
        export default function...
        ```
        
        [❌ WRONG - This is a markdown code block, not a saved file!]
        [❌ User sees CODE text, not a rendered graphic]
        [❌ File is not saved to outputs directory]
        [❌ No artifact link provided]
        [❌ This defeats the entire purpose of artifacts]
```

## Multi-Graphic Support

This skill supports creating **multiple graphics for a single article**.

### Workflow for Multiple Graphics

1. **Analyze content** → Identify 3-5 graphic opportunities
2. **Recommend placements** → Specific section placement for each
3. **Create .jsx files one by one using create_file tool** → Each saves to outputs directory and renders
4. **Batch convert** → After all approved, convert all to HubSpot

**Technical Implementation:**
- Use `create_file` to save each graphic: 
  - `/mnt/user-data/outputs/graphic-1-infographic.jsx`
  - `/mnt/user-data/outputs/graphic-2-timeline.jsx`
  - `/mnt/user-data/outputs/graphic-3-metrics.jsx`
- Each file automatically renders in the interface
- User sees all rendered graphics, NOT code
- NO markdown code blocks until HubSpot conversion phase

### Numbering Convention

When creating multiple graphics for one article:
- Graphic 1: [Type] - [Placement]
- Graphic 2: [Type] - [Placement]
- Graphic 3: [Type] - [Placement]

Example:
- Graphic 1: Three-column infographic - After intro
- Graphic 2: Timeline - Section "Implementation"
- Graphic 3: Metric cards - Before conclusion

## When to Use This Skill

Use when:
- Creating 1-5 graphics for a single blog post
- Need to see rendered graphics (not code) before deploying
- Want clean, maintainable HubSpot module code
- Require brand-compliant designs that match the active client's brand
- Converting Figma designs or v0.dev components

**Key benefit:** Visual preview via React artifacts, not code blocks

## Quick Start Examples

### Example 1: Single Graphic with React Artifact

```
User: "Create a three-column infographic showing:
       - Data Explosion (12% analyzed, 400M TB daily)  
       - Repeatability Crisis (67% lack docs)
       - Measurement Gaps (40% forecast miss)"

Claude: [Uses create_file tool to save .jsx file]
        [File automatically renders in Claude's interface as artifact]
        
        "Here's your three-column infographic: [View graphic](computer:///mnt/user-data/outputs/data-challenges-infographic.jsx)"
        
        [User sees the VISUAL GRAPHIC rendered, NOT code]
        
        "Does this look good to you?"

User: "Perfect! Give me the HubSpot code"

Claude: [NOW outputs HTML/CSS/JS in markdown code blocks for HubSpot]
        
        ### module.html
        ```html
        <!-- HubSpot module HTML -->
        <div class="data-challenges-infographic">...</div>
        ```
        
        ### module.css
        ```css
        /* HubSpot module CSS */
        .data-challenges-infographic { ... }
        ```
```

### Example 2: Multiple Graphics for One Article

```
User: "Analyze this blog post and create 3 graphics"
      [pastes 2000-word post]

Claude: [Runs analysis]
        "I recommend:
         1. Three-column infographic (after intro)
         2. Timeline (section 3)
         3. Metric cards (before conclusion)
         
         Creating Graphic 1..."
         
        [Uses create_file: graphic-1-infographic.jsx]
        "Graphic 1 ready: [View infographic](computer:///mnt/user-data/outputs/graphic-1-infographic.jsx)"

User: "Good! Next one"

Claude: "Creating Graphic 2..."
        [Uses create_file: graphic-2-timeline.jsx]
        "Graphic 2 ready: [View timeline](computer:///mnt/user-data/outputs/graphic-2-timeline.jsx)"

User: "Great! Last one"

Claude: "Creating Graphic 3..."
        [Uses create_file: graphic-3-metrics.jsx]
        "Graphic 3 ready: [View metrics](computer:///mnt/user-data/outputs/graphic-3-metrics.jsx)"

User: "All approved! Convert all to HubSpot"

Claude: [NOW outputs markdown code blocks with 3 sets of module files]
        
        ## Graphic 1: Three-Column Infographic
        ### graphic-1-infographic.html
        ```html
        ...
        ```
        ### graphic-1-infographic.css
        ```css
        ...
        ```
        
        ## Graphic 2: Timeline
        ### graphic-2-timeline.html
        ```html
        ...
        ```
        ### graphic-2-timeline.css
        ```css
        ...
        ```
        
        ## Graphic 3: Metric Cards
        ### graphic-3-metrics.html
        ```html
        ...
        ```
        ### graphic-3-metrics.css
        ```css
        ...
        ```
```

### Example 3: Preview Then Iterate

```
User: "Create metric cards for Q4 results"

Claude: [Uses create_file: q4-metrics.jsx]
        "Here are your Q4 metric cards: [View metrics](computer:///mnt/user-data/outputs/q4-metrics.jsx)"
        
        [User sees rendered graphic in interface]

User: "Can you make the numbers bigger and add icons?"

Claude: [Updates the .jsx file with str_replace or create_file]
        "Updated! [View updated metrics](computer:///mnt/user-data/outputs/q4-metrics.jsx)"
        
        [User sees updated rendered graphic]

User: "Perfect! HubSpot code please"

Claude: [NOW outputs HTML/CSS in markdown code blocks]
        
        ### q4-metrics.html
        ```html
        <div class="q4-metrics">...</div>
        ```
        
        ### q4-metrics.css
        ```css
        .q4-metrics { ... }
        ```
```

## React Artifact File Format

**⚠️ CRITICAL: Every graphic MUST be created using the `create_file` tool to save a .jsx file to `/mnt/user-data/outputs/`, NOT as a code block in chat.**

### How to Create React Artifacts (The ONLY Correct Method)

**THE CORRECT WAY - Use create_file Tool:**

```python
# Step 1: Use create_file tool
create_file(
  description="Creating blog graphic for data challenges",
  path="/mnt/user-data/outputs/blog-graphic.jsx",
  file_text="""import { Database, RotateCw, Gauge } from 'lucide-react';

export default function BlogGraphic() {
  return (
    <div style={{ 
      width: '800px',
      margin: '0 auto',
      fontFamily: 'Lato, sans-serif'
    }}>
      {/* Your graphic content */}
    </div>
  );
}"""
)

# Step 2: Provide artifact link to user
# "Here's your graphic: [View graphic](computer:///mnt/user-data/outputs/blog-graphic.jsx)"

# Result: 
# ✅ File is saved to outputs directory
# ✅ Claude's interface automatically renders it as a visual artifact
# ✅ User sees the VISUAL GRAPHIC in the interface, NOT code
# ✅ User can click the link to view/interact with the rendered graphic
```

**THE WRONG WAY - DON'T DO THIS:**

```markdown
# ❌ NEVER output code in markdown code blocks like this:

```jsx
import { Database } from 'lucide-react';
export default function MyGraphic() { 
  return <div>...</div>;
}
```

This is WRONG because:
- ❌ Code appears as text in the chat thread
- ❌ File is NOT saved to outputs directory  
- ❌ Does NOT render as a visual artifact
- ❌ User sees CODE text, not a rendered graphic
- ❌ No artifact link is provided
```

### Technical Flow

1. **You call create_file tool** with .jsx extension
2. **File saves to** `/mnt/user-data/outputs/graphic-name.jsx`
3. **Claude's interface detects** the .jsx file extension
4. **React component auto-renders** as a visual artifact
5. **You provide link** to the rendered artifact
6. **User sees** the rendered graphic (NOT code)

### Artifact File Structure

**IMPORTANT: This code structure is what you pass to the `create_file` tool. The user NEVER sees this code - they only see the RENDERED result.**

> ⚠️ **Inline hex values in the JSX examples below are placeholders for illustration only.** In real artifacts you generate, define a `BRAND` constant at the top of the file from the active client's `colors.json` and `typography.json`, and reference `BRAND.primary`, `BRAND.accent`, `BRAND.headingFont`, etc. Never copy inline hex from these examples into a real client's graphic.

**Required BRAND constant pattern** (every artifact must start with this):

```jsx
// Loaded from {clientsDir}/{slug}/brand/colors.json + typography.json at generation time
const BRAND = {
  primary: '<from colors.json>',
  secondary: '<from colors.json>',
  accent: '<from colors.json>',
  background: '<from colors.json>',
  text: '<from colors.json>',
  headingFont: '<from typography.json>',
  bodyFont: '<from typography.json>',
};
```

**What you do:**
```python
create_file(
  path="/mnt/user-data/outputs/blog-graphic.jsx",
  file_text="""
// This code is passed to create_file
// User will see the RENDERED graphic, not this code

import { IconName1, IconName2 } from 'lucide-react';

export default function BlogGraphic() {
  return (
    <div style={{ 
      width: '800px',
      margin: '0 auto',
      fontFamily: 'Lato, sans-serif'
    }}>
      {/* Your graphic content here */}
      <h2 style={{ fontFamily: 'Montserrat, sans-serif', color: '#000FC4' }}>
        Your Headline
      </h2>
    </div>
  );
}
"""
)
```

**What user sees:**
- ✅ A link to the artifact: `[View graphic](computer:///mnt/user-data/outputs/blog-graphic.jsx)`
- ✅ The rendered visual graphic in Claude's interface
- ✅ Interactive, clickable, visual result
- ❌ NOT the code above - they never see the JSX code

### Artifact Requirements

✅ **Must include:**
- Import statements for lucide-react icons
- Export default function
- Inline styles (no external CSS)
- Proper React/JSX syntax
- Brand-compliant colors (hex codes)
- Responsive considerations

✅ **Must use:**
- lucide-react for icons
- Inline style objects
- Active client color palette — loaded from `{clientsDir}/{slug}/brand/colors.json`. Reference as `BRAND.primary`, `BRAND.accent`, `BRAND.background`, `BRAND.text`. Never use inline hex.
- Active client typography — loaded from `{clientsDir}/{slug}/brand/typography.json`. Reference as `BRAND.headingFont` and `BRAND.bodyFont`. Never use inline font names.

❌ **NEVER DO:**
- Output code in markdown code blocks in chat (unless converting to HubSpot)
- Show TSX/JSX code to the user (they should see rendered graphics)
- Use external CSS files
- Use non-brand colors
- Create code blocks when user asks for graphics

### Correct Implementation Flow

1. **User asks for graphic** → You use `create_file` tool to save .jsx file (NOT markdown code block)
   ```python
   create_file(path="/mnt/user-data/outputs/graphic.jsx", file_text="...")
   ```

2. **Artifact auto-renders** → User sees visual result in Claude's interface
   - Provide artifact link: `[View graphic](computer:///mnt/user-data/outputs/graphic.jsx)`
   - User clicks link or sees inline rendered graphic
   
3. **User gives feedback** → You update the .jsx file if needed (still using create_file or str_replace, never code blocks)
   ```python
   str_replace(path="/mnt/user-data/outputs/graphic.jsx", old_str="...", new_str="...")
   ```

4. **User approves** → ONLY NOW you output HubSpot conversion as markdown code blocks
   ```markdown
   ### module.html
   ```html
   <div class="graphic">...</div>
   ```
   ```

**Key Point:** Steps 1-3 use file tools (create_file, str_replace). Code NEVER appears as markdown blocks in chat until step 4. User only sees rendered graphics via artifact links.

### Example: Complete React Artifact Implementation

**⚠️ CRITICAL: This shows what you pass to `create_file`. The user NEVER sees this code - they see the rendered graphic.**

**What you do (use create_file tool):**

```python
create_file(

  path="/mnt/user-data/outputs/three-column-infographic.jsx",
  file_text="""// Graphic 1: Three-Column Infographic

**Then you say to user:**
```
"Here's your three-column infographic: [View graphic](computer:///mnt/user-data/outputs/three-column-infographic.jsx)"
```

**What user sees:**
- ✅ A clickable link to the rendered artifact
- ✅ The visual graphic rendered in Claude's interface (3 columns with icons, numbers, text)
- ✅ Interactive, beautifully formatted visual result

**What user does NOT see:**
- ❌ The JSX code above
- ❌ Import statements
- ❌ Function definitions
- ❌ Style objects

**Remember:** When creating graphics, ALWAYS use create_file to save .jsx files. User sees rendered visuals, NOT code.

## Multi-Graphic Workflows

### Workflow A: Sequential Creation

**Best for:** Creating 2-5 graphics one at a time

```
Step 1: Analyze content → Identify opportunities
Step 2: Create Graphic 1 TSX artifact → Get approval
Step 3: Create Graphic 2 TSX artifact → Get approval
Step 4: Create Graphic 3 TSX artifact → Get approval
Step 5: Batch convert all to HubSpot modules
```

**Example conversation:**
```
User: "Create 3 graphics for this post"

Claude: "I'll create them one by one.
         
         Graphic 1: Three-column infographic
         Placement: After intro
         
         [TSX ARTIFACT 1]"

User: "Good, next"

Claude: "Graphic 2: Timeline
         Placement: Section 'Implementation'
         
         [TSX ARTIFACT 2]"

User: "Perfect, last one"

Claude: "Graphic 3: Metric cards
         Placement: Before conclusion
         
         [TSX ARTIFACT 3]"

User: "All approved! Convert to HubSpot"

Claude: [Outputs 3 HubSpot module sets]
```

### Workflow B: Batch Preview

**Best for:** Review all graphics before converting any

```
Step 1: Create ALL TSX artifacts first
Step 2: User reviews all previews
Step 3: Make any adjustments
Step 4: Convert all to HubSpot at once
```

**Example conversation:**
```
User: "Create all graphics for this post, let me review all before converting"

Claude: "Creating 3 graphics for review...
         
         === Graphic 1 ===
         Type: Three-column
         Placement: After intro
         [TSX ARTIFACT 1]
         
         === Graphic 2 ===
         Type: Timeline
         Placement: Section 3
         [TSX ARTIFACT 2]
         
         === Graphic 3 ===
         Type: Metric cards
         Placement: Conclusion
         [TSX ARTIFACT 3]
         
         Review all three and let me know if any need changes."

User: "All look great! Convert all to HubSpot"

Claude: [Outputs 3 HubSpot module sets]
```

### Workflow C: Iterative Refinement

**Best for:** Complex graphics needing adjustments

```
Step 1: Create initial TSX artifact
Step 2: User requests changes
Step 3: Update TSX artifact
Step 4: Repeat until approved
Step 5: Convert to HubSpot
```

**Example conversation:**
```
User: "Create a timeline for Q1 roadmap"

Claude: [TSX ARTIFACT - version 1]

User: "Make the icons bigger and add more spacing"

Claude: [TSX ARTIFACT - version 2 with changes]

User: "Perfect! HubSpot code please"

Claude: [Outputs module files]
```

## Graphic Naming Convention

### For Single Graphic

```
// Blog Graphic: [Descriptive Name]
// Article: [Blog post title]
// Placement: [Section name or position]
```

### For Multiple Graphics

```
// Graphic 1 of 3: [Type] - [Brief description]
// Placement: After [section]
// Dimensions: 800px × 900px

// Graphic 2 of 3: [Type] - [Brief description]
// Placement: Section "[name]"
// Dimensions: 800px × 1200px

// Graphic 3 of 3: [Type] - [Brief description]
// Placement: Before conclusion
// Dimensions: 800px × 600px
```

## HubSpot Conversion (Phase 2)

## Conversion Guidelines

### JSX → HTML

```jsx
// JSX (TSX artifact)
<div className="card">
  <Database size={32} color="#000FC4" />
  {items.map(item => <p>{item}</p>)}
</div>

// HTML (HubSpot)
<div class="card">
  <svg class="icon-database" width="32" height="32" viewBox="0 0 24 24">
    <ellipse cx="12" cy="5" rx="9" ry="3"></ellipse>
    <path d="M21 12c0 1.66-4 3-9 3s-9-1.34-9-3"></path>
    <path d="M3 5v14c0 1.66 4 3 9 3s9-1.34 9-3V5"></path>
  </svg>
  <p>Item 1</p>
  <p>Item 2</p>
</div>
```

**Key changes:**
- `className` → `class`
- lucide-react → inline SVG
- `{variable}` → static text
- `.map()` → duplicate HTML

### Tailwind → CSS

```jsx
// TSX
<div className="flex items-center gap-4 p-6 rounded-lg bg-blue-600 text-white">

// CSS
.container {
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  gap: 1rem;
  padding: 1.5rem;
  border-radius: 0.5rem;
  background-color: #000FC4;
  color: #FFFFFF;
}
```

**Common conversions:**
- `p-6` → `padding: 1.5rem;`
- `flex` → `display: flex;`
- `gap-4` → `gap: 1rem;`
- `text-2xl` → `font-size: 1.5rem; line-height: 2rem;`

### React Hooks → Vanilla JS

```jsx
// React
const [active, setActive] = useState(0);

// Vanilla
let state = { active: 0 };
function setActive(index) {
  state.active = index;
  render();
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Create artifacts, not code** - ALWAYS use .jsx artifacts, NEVER code blocks for graphics
2. **Visual preview first** - User must see rendered graphic before conversion
3. **Get feedback** - Ask if design looks good before converting
4. **Self-contained** - Keep all styles inline in React artifact
5. **Responsive** - Use mobile-first approach
6. **Brand compliant** - Always load brand colors from `{clientsDir}/{slug}/brand/colors.json` and fonts from `typography.json`. Never hardcode hex values or font names — they leak between clients.
7. **Clean code** - Well-commented, organized
8. **Accessible** - Semantic HTML, ARIA labels, alt text

## Output Format

### Phase 1: React Artifact (Visual Preview)

**Create a .jsx artifact file** → User sees rendered graphic in interface

Example conversation:
```
Claude: [Creates graphic-1.jsx artifact]
        "Here's your three-column infographic showing the data explosion, 
         repeatability crisis, and measurement gaps. Does it look good?"
```

**NO CODE IN CHAT** - Only the rendered visual appears.

### Phase 2: HubSpot Module (After Approval)

**Output HTML/CSS/JS in markdown code blocks** → User copies to HubSpot

Example conversation:
```
User: "Perfect! Give me the HubSpot code"

Claude: "Here are your HubSpot module files:"
        
        ### module.html
        ```html
        [Clean HTML structure]
        ```
        
        ### module.css
        ```css
        [Organized CSS]
        ```
        
        ### module.js (if needed)
        ```javascript
        [Vanilla JavaScript]
        ```

        ## Implementation Notes
        - Responsive: 320px-1280px
        - Browser support: Modern browsers
        - Dependencies: None (inline SVG)
```

## Troubleshooting

**Artifact not rendering?**
→ Check React syntax, ensure export default
→ Verify all imports (lucide-react)

**Colors don't match brand?**
→ Use exact hex: #000FC4, #2DE4E6, #F26419
→ Reference brand-guidelines.md

**Layout breaks on mobile?**
→ Add responsive breakpoints
→ Test at 320px, 768px, 1024px

**HubSpot module not working?**
→ Verify all SVG is inline
→ Check CSS class prefixes
→ Test in HubSpot preview

### q1-timeline.html
```html
<div class="timeline-container">...</div>
```

### q1-timeline.css
```css
.timeline-container { ... }
```
```

### Example 3: With content analysis

```
User: "Analyze this post and suggest graphics"
[pastes 2000-word blog post]

Claude: [Runs analyze_content.py script or analyzes manually]

"I found 4 graphic opportunities:

1. Section 'The Challenge' → Three-column infographic (3 stats found)
2. Section 'Implementation' → Timeline (5 phases detected)
3. Section 'Results' → Data visualization (6 metrics)
4. Section 'Comparison' → Side-by-side table (vs. traditional)

Which would you like me to create first?"

User: "Create the three-column infographic"

Claude: [Uses create_file to save infographic.jsx]

"Here's your three-column infographic: [View graphic](computer:///mnt/user-data/outputs/challenge-infographic.jsx)

This graphic would work well right after your introduction paragraph. Would you like to see the next one?"
```

        3. Metric cards (before conclusion)
        
        Creating Graphic 1..."
        
        [Uses create_file: graphic-1-infographic.jsx]
        
        "Graphic 1: [View infographic](computer:///mnt/user-data/outputs/graphic-1-infographic.jsx)"

User: "Good! Next"

Claude: "Creating Graphic 2..."
        
        [Uses create_file: graphic-2-timeline.jsx]
        
        "Graphic 2: [View timeline](computer:///mnt/user-data/outputs/graphic-2-timeline.jsx)"

User: "Perfect! Last one"

Claude: "Creating Graphic 3..."

```
```

## Quick Reference

**Request graphic:**
```
"Create a [type] showing [data/content]"
```

**Multiple graphics:**
```
"Create [number] graphics for this article"
"Analyze and recommend graphics"
```

**Critical Reminders:**
1. ✅ ALWAYS use `create_file` tool to save .jsx files to `/mnt/user-data/outputs/`
2. ✅ ALWAYS provide artifact links: `[View graphic](computer:///mnt/user-data/outputs/file.jsx)`
3. ✅ User sees rendered graphics in interface (NOT TypeScript/JSX code)
4. ✅ Support multiple graphics per article (separate .jsx files)
5. ✅ Get visual approval before HubSpot conversion
6. ✅ Only output HTML/CSS/JS code in markdown blocks AFTER approval
7. ✅ Use exact brand colors (#000FC4, #2DE4E6, #F26419)
8. ✅ Use `str_replace` to iterate on graphics (not new code blocks)
9. ✅ Number graphics clearly (graphic-1, graphic-2, graphic-3)
10. ✅ Include placement info for each graphic

**Technical Implementation:**
- **Create**: `create_file(path="/mnt/user-data/outputs/name.jsx", file_text="...")`
- **Update**: `str_replace(path="/mnt/user-data/outputs/name.jsx", old_str="...", new_str="...")`
- **Link**: `[View graphic](computer:///mnt/user-data/outputs/name.jsx)`
- **Never**: Output JSX code in markdown code blocks in chat

**Version:** 3.1.0 (Technical Implementation Clarity Update)
**Last Updated:** November 2024
